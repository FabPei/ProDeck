# ProDeck

ProDeck is a PowerPoint add-in designed to help those who work extensively with PowerPoint, such as consultants. While many paid products offer similar or more advanced functionalities, ProDeck was created to democratize access to these tools for individuals and small companies that may not have the budget for expensive software. ProDeck offers several features to help users edit slides more efficiently, saving valuable time.

## Why I Created This

I tested several commercial options like [Power-User](https://www.powerusersoftwares.com/) and [BrightSlide](https://www.brightcarbon.com/brightslide/), but found they either didn’t offer the exact features I needed or were overloaded with unnecessary tools. I also tried other free and open-source alternatives, but they were often too rough and riddled with bugs.

With that in mind, I developed ProDeck based on three core principles:
1. **Simplicity**: Include only the essential functions most users need, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
2. **Seamless Integration**: Avoid intrusive branding by using icons already available in Microsoft PowerPoint. If a required icon isn’t available, I hand-draw it to match the Office design language.
3. **Polished and Intuitive**: Ensure the add-in is bug-free, easy to use, and intuitive. For example, buttons in ProDeck are grayed out when a function cannot be applied, mimicking the official Office behavior. The goal is for users to feel as though this add-in was developed by Microsoft itself.

## Requirements

- **Microsoft Office**: ProDeck was developed for the latest version of Office, but it may work on older versions with potential bugs.
- **Windows or Mac**: While ProDeck works on both Windows and Mac, it performs better on Windows. In the future, I plan to release a Mac-specific version to address certain features and characteristics.
